# FGO_Api_Project

# By Chethram Ramoutar

This repo represents an API project based on Fate Grand Order, that I developed. 
In order to create the api yourself:

1) Download the .SQL files and the .CSV files in the "SQL Table Files" folder
2) Open MySQL Workbench and use the .SQL file downloaded to create the database and the tables.
3) Import table data using the .CSV files downloaded from the repo.
